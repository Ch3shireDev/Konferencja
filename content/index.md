title: Ecology in a Changing World - PhD Student Conference
date: 2018-11-04

<span id='start'>
Welcome to the PhD Student Conference, _Ecology in a Changing World_.

The conference will be held on the 23th to 25th of March 2019, in Biological and Chemical Research Centre, University of Warsaw, Żwirki i Wigury 101, 02-089 Warsaw.

The meeting is open to PhD students of plant, animal and landscape ecology, their supervisors and other ecologists from any country. The aim of this meeting is to give an opportunity to young scientists to share their scientific ideas, experiences and improve presentation skills in English.

We do not expect conference-type presentations, which pretend that everything is already solved. Presentations can include open questions and discussions of possible alternative ideas or methods.

After the conference participants will have a possibility to take part either in an after-conference excursion or a workshop.

Join us at Polish Ecological Society (Polskie Towarzystwo Ekologiczne, PTEkol) General Meeting!

During the conference the general meeting of Polish Ecological Society will be held. We invite you to attend the meeting and join the Society. We are going to discuss future plans and actions of the Society.

We look forward to welcoming you!
