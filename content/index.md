Welcome to the PhD Student Conference, _Ecology in a Changing World_.

The conference will be held on the 23th to 25th of March 2019, in Biological and Chemical Research Centre, University of Warsaw, Żwirki i Wigury 101, 02-089 Warsaw.

The meeting is open to PhD students of plant, animal and landscape ecology, conservation ecology, biogeochemistry and microbial ecology, their supervisors and other ecologists from any country. The aim of this meeting is to give an opportunity to young scientists to share their scientific ideas, experiences and improve presentation skills in English. We do not expect conference-type presentations, which pretend that everything is already solved. Presentations can include open questions and discussions of possible alternative ideas or methods.

After the conference participants will have a possibility to take part either in an after-conference excursion or a workshop.

**Post-conference excursion to the Central Vistula Valley (Natura 2000 area).**

<small>Date: Monday, 25 March 2019 at 10:00-16:00 hrs.</small>

We are pleased to invite you to the excursion to the Warsaw section of Vistula valley - an outstanding natural area. Warsaw is the only capital in Europe with the natural, unregulated river, protected within a Natura 2000 site, flowing through it. The river banks and its islands are essential breeding habitats for many rare bird species related to the alluvial forests and unstable sandy islands. The Vistula is also an important migratory corridor for birds such as ducks, swans, osprey, seagulls, cormorants, terns and waders as well as many passerine species. It is also a wintering place for various species of ducks, gulls and white-tailed sea eagles, which can be even seen in the city center during the winter. At that time of the year we would be able to spot many bird species belonging to all of the abovementioned groups. The natural character of the riverbed allowed for the preservation of patches of nearly natural alluvial forests. However, until recently most of the valley was covered with semi-natural meadows and pastures, many of high natural value. The abandonment of the traditional management allowed for the comeback of the forest but on the other hand, it facilitated the invasive species encroachment, such as American goldenrod. During the trip, therer will be the opportunity to see the place where Vistula river meadow restoration project took place in 2014-2016 and see if it was successful in suppressing alien, invasive plant species and increasing the biodiversity of the floodplain grasslands.

Excursion led by: 

dr hab. Przemysław Chylarecki, prof PAS
> An ornithologist from Museum and Institute of Zoology, Polish Academy of Sciences, whose main research interests particularly focus on functioning of river valley ecosystems, especially breeding biology of waders, and ecology of forests. He is an expert providing scientific background for nature conservation. (tbc)

dr Łukasz Kozub
> A botanist from Department of Plant Ecology and Nature Conservation, University of Warsaw, whose main research interests focus on the ecology of wetlands, especially peatlands, and on the restoration of non-forest ecosystems. He is actively involved in many nature conservation projects.

**R Workshop**

<small>Date: Monday, 25 March 2019 at 17:00-20:00 hrs.</small>

In the workshop we will exercise a very simple example of a typical data analysis workflow according to the scheme: **import**, **tidy**, **transform**, **visualise**, **model**, using basic concepts of **dplyr**, **data.table** and **ggplot2** packages. 

Please bring your own laptop. 

Number of participants is limited. 

Instructor:

mgr Klara Goldstein
>PhD student from Department of Plant Ecology and Nature Conservation, University of Warsaw, quantitative ecologist.

Since the beginning of his professional career Bogdan Jaroszewicz has been working in the Białowieża Forest: till 2005 he worked for over a decade in the administration of the Białowieża National Park and then, as a scientist, he carried out most of his studies in this special forest. Aside of teaching at the Faculty of Biology (Nature conservation, Ecology, Botany) and carrying research (over 100 scientific and popular publications), recently he is deeply involved into the iniciatives aimed on increasing of the efficiency of protection of the Białowieża Forest.

## Polish Ecological Society (PTEkol)

##### NOTE ON RE-ACTIVATION OF POLISH ECOLOGICAL SOCIETY 

<button id='button-en'>(click here for the Polish version)</button>

The first communication on the ECHO Conference, included information on a planned General Meeting of the Polish Ecological Society. This information was formally incorrect, we apologise for this. In fact, using the occasion of the conference, we are planning to organise an organisational meeting dedicated to a re-activation of the society. Polish Ecological Society (Polskie Towarzystwo Ekologiczne, PTEkol) was established in 1993 and was active during the following 20 years. After this period the society’s activity was, however, discontinued, which resulted in a formal removal of the Society from State registers in 2018. The undersigned represent a group of Polish ecology scholars, including members of the last Board of PTEkol and young scientists - organisers of the ECHO conference. Our initial consultations indicated that there is a need to re-activate the Society, which should again serve as the main forum for exchanging scientific ideas among Polish ecologists, facilitate contacts with foreign scientists and become a source of scientific opinions and initiatives related to a broadly-understood field of ecology. The organisational meeting will be carried out just after the ECHO conference and will be soon announced in a separate communication.

<small>Prof dr hab. Andrzej Nienartowicz (Nicolaus Copernicus University in Toruń, Faculty of Biology and Environmental Protection) – in the name of the last Board of PTEkol,</small>

<small>Dr hab. Wiktor Kotowski (University of Warsaw, Faculty of Biology) – in the name of the Scientific Committee of the conference ECHO - Ecology in the Changing World.</small>

#### INFORMACJA O SPOTKANIU REAKTYWACYJNYM POLSKIEGO TOWARZYSTWA EKOLOGICZNEGO

<button id='button-pl'>(click here for the English version)</button>

Szanowni Państwo,

W pierwszym komunikacie dotyczącym konferencji ECHO znalazła się informacja o planie zorganizowania w czasie konferencji Walnego Zgromadzenia Polskiego Towarzystwa Ekologicznego. Informacja ta, z formalnego punktu widzenia, była błędna, za co serdecznie przepraszamy. W rzeczywistości, planowane jest zorganizowanie spotkania organizacyjnego dotyczącego reaktywacji ww. Stowarzyszenia. Polskie Towarzystwo Ekologiczne (PTEkol) zostało utworzone w 1993 roku i czynnie funkcjonowało przez kolejne 20 lat. Po tym okresie jednak działalność Stowarzyszenia została zawieszona, co doprowadziło do formalnego usunięcia go z krajowego rejestru w 2018 roku. Niżej podpisani, reprezentując grupę polskich ekologów akademickich, w tym Członków ostatniego Zarządu PTEkol, a także młodych naukowców organizujących konferencję ECHO, wyrażają przekonanie o potrzebie reaktywacji Polskiego Towarzystwa Ekologicznego, jako forum wymiany doświadczeń i idei naukowych, łącznik ze środowiskami naukowców zagranicznych oraz ciało opiniotwórcze reprezentujące środowisko szeroko-ujętej ekologii. Spotkanie organizacyjne poświęcone reaktywacji PTEkol odbędzie się bezpośrednio po konferencji ECHO i zostanie wkrótce dodatkowo ogłoszone w osobnym komunikacie.

<small>Prof dr hab. Andrzej Nienartowicz (Wydział Biologii i Ochrony Środowiska Uniwersytetu Mikołaja Kopernika w Toruniu) – w imieniu ostatniego Zarządu PTEkol,</small>

<small>Dr hab. Wiktor Kotowski (Wydział Biologii Uniwersytetu Warszawskiego) – w imieniu Komitetu Naukowego Konferencji ECHO – Ecology in the Changing World.</small>
